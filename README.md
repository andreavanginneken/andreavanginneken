## Hello! 

I'm Andrea, a web developer with a passion for problem solving. Before transitioning to software development, I obtained my undergraduate degree from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in Hospitality. I bring a myriad of skills to the table, including customer service, teamworking, and logical reasoning. Over the course of the last crazy year, I learned to create full-stack applications using: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, Express, Node.js, React.js, and the list goes on.
